## Example — Skill Development Session Retrospective

```
AGENT REVIEWER — Task Retrospective
Task     : 10 Agentic Skill Development
Score    : 8.7/10
Findings : 0 critical | 2 moderate | 4 positive

## Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Score | Summary |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Goal Alignment | 9/10 | All 10 skills completed and tested |
| Efficiency | 8/10 | Some skills written sequentially that could have been parallel |
| Decision Quality | 9/10 | Naming decision corrected quickly |
| Error Handling | 9/10 | File exists error resolved fast |
| Communication | 8/10 | 2 questions asked per skill — efficient |
| Reusability | 9/10 | Skills complement each other, ecosystem formed |
| **Overall** | **8.7/10** | |

## Improvement Areas
- error-recovery and agent-reviewer could have been written in parallel
- output-critic was only applied to task-decomposer, not all skills

## What Went Well
- Existing skill ecosystem was researched, original skills developed
- Every skill tested, not just documentation but working output
- Skills cross-reference each other (ecosystem thinking)
- Memory-ledger preserved session context

## Action Items
### For Next Task
1. Apply output-critic to every skill automatically
2. Trigger parallel-planner earlier — skill pairs can be written in parallel

### Skill Improvement
1. output-critic -> integrate into all skill development workflows
2. Produce a unified catalog/README for all 10 skills
